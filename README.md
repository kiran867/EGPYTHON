# EGPYTHON
Online Food Ordering System. With the help of this project, the user can place order based on the required quantitiy of the dish available in the menu. The total is calculated base on the price of the dish, service charge and GST. The total price with and without tax will be displayed along with unique order id for each cycle. Furthermore there is an embedded virtual calculator within the project to cross verify the result.
